[00:09.27] This fever's got no fall
[00:11.35] Temperature's crazy off the wall
[00:13.02] Get ready like stop, drop, roll
[00:15.10] Not gonna break a sweat at all
[00:17.15] Sparks light that candle fire
[00:21.11] The phoenix rises higher
[00:25.67] Frigid, frozen, no limits
[00:28.51] Deadly cold, 10 below
[00:32.05] 支配したいよ君の心を
[00:34.70] いいこ？
[00:38.02] 僕の？
[00:39.44] No more!
[00:39.99] Fire it up, fire it up now
[00:41.92] Hot passion, never back down
[00:43.65] Freeze you out, freeze you out now
[00:45.16] Not about to bend to you
[00:47.33] Fire and ice, death and life, now
[00:49.52] High pressure, turn it up loud
[00:51.28] Fire and ice, fire and ice, now
[00:53.32] This world's all smoke and mirrors
[00:54.96] Na na na na na
[00:57.12] 君の思う価値
[00:58.84] Na na na na na
[01:00.00] 超えて超えて
[01:02.60] Na na na na na
[01:04.65] じっと息を呑んで
[01:06.49] Na na na na na
[01:08.68] 染めて染めて
[01:10.64] Blazing, unchanging
[01:12.48] No strange thing about this heat, witness me
[01:15.45] Hit this beat, rinse repeat
[01:17.84] These feelings got me freezing up
[01:34.34] 
[01:21.63] 中毒性の愛は
[01:25.70] 身休中いまか巡らせば
[01:28.86] Can't control, overflow
[01:33.11] つかまえたいの君の心を
[01:39.06] でもね?
[01:39.55] だって？
[01:40.14] No more!
[01:40.79] Fire it up, fire it up now
[01:42.90] Hot passion, never back down
[01:44.47] Freeze you out, freeze you out now
[01:46.54] Not about to bend to you
[01:48.34] Fire and ice, death and life, now
[01:50.54] High pressure, turn it up loud
[01:52.30] Fire and ice, fire and ice, now
[01:54.46] This world's all smoke and mirrors
[01:56.23] Na na na na na
[01:58.06] うるさいその口
[01:59.62] Na na na na na
[02:01.90] 閉じて閉じて
[02:03.46] Na na na na na
[02:05.63] 有毒性の「I」を
[02:07.35] Na na na na na
[02:09.34] 込めて込めて
[02:11.02] We're caught up in the eye of a storm of flame
[02:12.82] It's not complicated, but a nuanced game
[02:14.90] A past you once gave me something I can't shake
[02:16.66] The chances knowing somebody who had moves to make
[02:18.54] So whatcha waiting for? You gotta burn it up
[02:20.42] Cuz when it rains it pours, ya gotta earn the love
[02:22.46] I'm never given in
[02:23.90] They'll never get enough
[02:24.75] Cuz you and I always rise above
[02:25.71] You got it?
[02:26.62] Fire it up, fire it up now
[02:28.54] Hot passion, never back down
[02:30.26] Freeze you out, freeze you out now
[02:32.26] Not about to bend to you
[02:33.98] Fire and ice, death and life, now
[02:36.10] High pressure, turn it up loud
[02:37.91] Fire and ice, fire and ice, now
[02:40.14] This world's all smoke and mirrors
[02:41.67] Na na na na na
[02:43.86] 君の思う価値
[02:45.42] Na na na na na
[02:47.71] 超えて超えて
[02:49.23] Na na na na na
[02:51.35] じっと息を呑んで
[02:53.11] Na na na na na
[02:55.99] 染めて染めて
